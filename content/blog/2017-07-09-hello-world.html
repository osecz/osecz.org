Welcome to <a href="/">OSECZ.org</a>. This website and blog is the
home of the OSECZ community.
</p>
<p>
Our community originated at
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=osecz">#osecz</a> channel of
Freenode IRC Network in January 2017. This community was formed to
promote discussion and collaboration on open source security projects,
security tools, protocols and standards. Some of the initial members of
the channel were members of the long-established ##security channel of
Freenode who were looking for a tiny, troll-free and friendly community.
You are welcome to join this channel and be a part of the community. You
are also welcome to invite your friends and colleagues to this channel
and help the channel grow.
</p>
<p>
It has been about six months since the channel was formed and we thought
that it would be nice to have a home for our community on the web. This
website and this blog is an attempt at this.
</p>
<p>
We have the following goals in growing our channel and creating this
website.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
    Bring information security professionals to a common open platform
    to share knowledge with each other and collaborate on security
    projects.
    </li>
    <li>
    Encourage students and technology professionals in gaining expertise
    in information security.
    </li>
    <li>
    Increase general awareness of information security among
    non-technical folks.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
In order to achieve these goals, we are expanding our network to social
media channels such as
<a href="https://twitter.com/osecz">Twitter</a>,
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/osecz/">LinkedIn</a> and
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/osecz/">Facebook</a>. We post our
updates and general security news at these places. If you use one or
more of these websites, please follow us there.
